# Family Tree Viewer

This is your personal family tree viewer, configured to display `3.ged`.

## How to Run

Double-click on **`start.bat`** to launch the viewer.
This will:
1. Start a local web server.
2. Automatically open your default web browser.
3. Load your family tree.

## Troubleshooting

- If the browser doesn't open, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html?url=3.ged` manually.
- If you see a blank screen, ensure `3.ged` is in this folder.
